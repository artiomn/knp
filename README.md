The Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform ("KNP" or "platform") is a software platform for developing, training and executing spiking neural networks on a variety of computers.

You can use Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform to do the following:

- Create spiking neural networks (SNNs) and train these on various types of input data, such as telemetry, events, images, 3D data, audio, and tactile data.
- Convert artificial neural networks (ANNs) into spiking networks and train these.
- Conduct applied research in the field of input data classification and other application domains of neural networks.
- Develop new neural network topologies, for example, impulse analogs of convolutional neural networks that involve convolution in space and time.
- Develop new models of synaptic plasticity.
- Implement new neuron models.
- Implement application solutions based on neuromorphic spiking neural networks in the field of robotic manipulators, Internet of Things, unmanned systems, human-machine interaction, wearable devices, and optimization planning.
- Implement application solutions on devices with low power consumption using neuromorphic processors.

You can use the C++ and Python languages to accomplish these tasks. The platform supports CPUs as well as the AltAI-1 neuromorphic processor unit designed for energy-efficient execution of neural networks in various types of intelligent devices.

For information on the platform concepts and architecture, installation instructions and platform use cases, see <a href="https://click.kaspersky.com/?hl=en-US&version=1.0&pid=KNP&link=online_help">Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform Help</a>.

Only versions of repository with release tags have release quality. If you use the source code from master branch or a build compiled from master branch, you may get code and build with errors and vulnerabilities.
