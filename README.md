The Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform ("KNP" or "platform") is a software platform for developing, training and executing spiking neural networks on a variety of computers.

You can use Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform to do the following:

- Create spiking neural networks (SNNs) and train these on various types of input data, such as telemetry, events, images, 3D data, audio, and tactile data.
- Convert artificial neural networks (ANNs) into spiking networks and train these.
- Conduct applied research in the field of input data classification and other application domains of neural networks.
- Develop new neural network topologies, for example, impulse analogs of convolutional neural networks that involve convolution in space and time.
- Develop new models of synaptic plasticity.
- Implement new neuron models.
- Implement application solutions based on neuromorphic spiking neural networks in the field of robotic manipulators, Internet of Things, unmanned systems, human-machine interaction, wearable devices, and optimization planning.
- Implement application solutions on devices with low power consumption using neuromorphic processors.

You can use the C++ and Python languages to accomplish these tasks. The platform supports CPUs as well as the AltAI-2 neuromorphic processor unit designed for energy-efficient execution of neural networks in various types of intelligent devices.

For information on the platform concepts and architecture, installation instructions and platform use cases, see <a href="https://click.kaspersky.com/?hl=en-US&version=2.0&pid=KNP&link=online_help&helpid=index">Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform Help</a>.

Only versions of repository with release tags have release quality. If you use the source code from master branch or a build compiled from master branch, you may get code and build with errors and vulnerabilities.

## Hardware and software requirements

For Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform operation, the computer must meet the following minimum requirements.

Minimum hardware requirements:

- CPU: Intel Core i5 or higher compatible processor
- GPU with CUDA support: NVIDIA GPU using Pascal or higher
- Neuromorphic processing unit (if needed): AltAI-2
- 8 GB of RAM
- Available hard drive space:
  - 1 GB for installing Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform.
  - 10 GB for building the platform or an application solution build.

Supported operating systems:

- Debian GNU/Linux 12.5 or later
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or later
- Windows 7
- Windows 10

You can use the device running any other operating system from the Linux family, if the operating system distribution kit contains the Boost library version 1.81 or later.
