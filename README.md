The Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform ("KNP" or "platform") is a software platform for developing, training and executing spiking neural networks on a variety of computers.

You can use Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform to do the following:

- Create spiking neural networks (SNNs) and train these on various types of input data, such as telemetry, events, images, 3D data, audio, and tactile data.
- Convert artificial neural networks (ANNs) into spiking networks and train these.
- Optimize the structure of the loaded neural networks.
- Conduct applied research in the field of input data classification and other application domains of neural networks.
- Develop new neural network topologies, for example, impulse analogs of convolutional neural networks that involve convolution in space and time.
- Develop new models of synaptic plasticity.
- Implement new neuron models.
- Implement application solutions based on neuromorphic spiking neural networks in the field of robotic manipulators, Internet of Things, unmanned systems, human-machine interaction, wearable devices, and optimization planning.
- Implement application solutions on devices with low power consumption or using neuromorphic processors.

You can use the C++ and Python languages to accomplish these tasks. The platform supports CPUs as well as the AltAI-1 neuromorphic processor unit designed for energy-efficient execution of neural networks in various types of intelligent devices.

For information on the platform concepts and architecture, installation instructions and platform use cases, see <a href="https://click.kaspersky.com/?hl=en-US&version=1.0&pid=KNP&link=online_help">Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform Help</a>.

### Scenario for building a platform project or an application solution

You can build a platform or an application solution in C++. The platform build can be used when developing the Kaspersky Neuromorphic Platform.

When developing application solutions, you can install the required deb packages instead of building the solution.

You can also use the Docker image `knp-build-image` included in the platform distribution kit to build the platform or an application.

A platform or application solution build script consists of the following stages:

1. Obtaining the platform source code

   You can get the platform source code in one of the following ways:

   - Download the archive with the source code from the platform repository and unpack it to the working directory.
   - Clone the platform repository.

1. Defining the Boost_ROOT setting in Windows

   In Windows, define the `Boost_ROOT` setting. To do this, create an environment variable or specify the path to the installed Boost library in the `CMakePresets.json` file located in the root directory with the platform source code.\
   You can define the path to the installed Boost library as a CMake invocation parameter using the following command:

   ```
   cmake -DBOOST-ROOT=<path to installed Boost library>
   ```

1. Configuring the build settings for the application solution

   In case of an application solution build, describe the build process in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. Specify the directory with the application to be built using the `add_subdirectory` function, specify the executable file using the `add_executable` function, and specify the platform libraries to be connected to the project using the `target_link_libraries` function. You can use the following libraries:

   - `neuron_traits`
   - `synapse_traits`
   - `core`
   - `meta`
   - `devices`
   - `backends`
   - `framework`

1. Configuring a platform or an application solution build

   If you are building a platform or an application solution on Linux, configure the build using the CMake build system. For more details on configuring a build using CMake, refer to the <a href="https://cmake.org/documentation/">CMake documentation</a>.\
   If you are building the platform or application solution in Windows, configure the build in Visual Studio. To do this, open the platform or application project by selecting the required `CMakeLists.txt` file and configure the cache. In case of an application solution build, select the `CMakeLists.txt` file of the application solution. In case of a platform build, select the `CMakeLists.txt` file located in the root directory with the platform source code.\
   The first build configuration with CMake may take too long to complete and fail with network errors. If network errors occur, please run the build configuration again.

1. Starting the build

   Start the platform or application solution build. For more details on starting the build of projects, refer to the <a href="https://cmake.org/documentation/">CMake documentation</a> or the documentation of the integrated development environment being used.
