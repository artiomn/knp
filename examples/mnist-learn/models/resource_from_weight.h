/**
 * @brief Calculate synaptic resource value from weight parameters for resource-based plasticity.
 * 
 * @details The transformation maps weight ranges to resource ranges while maintaining the inverse 
 * relationship between weight and resource in resource-based models.
 * 
 * The mathematical formula used is:
 * resource = (weight - min_weight) * (max_weight - min_weight) / ((max_weight - min_weight) - (weight - min_weight))
 * 
 * This ensures that:
 * - Minimum weights map to low resource values
 * - Maximum weights map to high resource values
 * 
 * @param weight current synaptic weight value to convert.
 * @param min_weight minimum allowable weight value for the range.
 * @param max_weight maximum allowable weight value for the range.
 * 
 * @return calculated resource value for the given weight.
 * 
 * @throws `std::logic_error` if weight is outside valid range or parameters are invalid.
